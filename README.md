TicTacToe in Python

THIS IS A TIC-TAC-TOE game created using Python. I made this in order to practice my skills with 
Python and also as an introduction to making a basic GUI for a program. Right now you can either play
against a CPU that chooses random squares or by selecting the button at the bottom you can switch to a 2 
player mode in order to play against your friends. I hope you enjoy :)
